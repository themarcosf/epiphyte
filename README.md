# Mechanistic Interpretability in the Presence of Architectural Obfuscation

This repository contains the code used in the production of the paper published on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

The codebase includes scripts, utilities, and notebooks for mechanistic interpretability experiments and analyses as described in the paper.

## Structure

- `mech_interp/`: Core utilities and experiment scripts
- `model/`: Model definitions, scripts, and experiment notebooks

For more details, please refer to the individual README files in subdirectories and comments within the code.
